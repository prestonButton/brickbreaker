We want this version to include:
1. Board Clear Bonus: If a player is able to clear all the bricks on the screen, they get the “Board Clear” animation, as well as adding extra balls to shoot on the next turn.They should get ~15% more balls for the next turn. 
2. 1x Ball Relocation: Adding the ability to relocate the starting point of the ball at the bottom of the screen. You get this ability only one time per game. 
3. Adding Brick Predictability: Similar to Tetris, every round you can see where the next round’s blocks are going to be positioned. I am thinking of having shadow blocks in the top layer which are very dim blocks that are 
in the top level, which is normally empty. These shadow blocks must be in the same columns the blocks form in the next turn. these shadow blocks do not have physics, so the ball does not interact with them, but they are
just to show where the bricks will appear next. 
4. Include color coding of the bricks to turn them from green to red as they get closer to 0.


You will edit the Bricbreaker-mock/Brickbreaker/GameScene.swift file as that file has all the code. Do NOT edit any other files. If it is easier to do this by recoding the game from scratch, that is ok too. I just need one file called GameScene.swift that runs the game with the updates I requested at the end.
